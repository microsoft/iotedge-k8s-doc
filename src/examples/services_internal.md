> This preview integration of IoT Edge 1.x and Kubernetes will not be made generally available, and is no longer supported. The recommended way to run IoT Edge 1.x on Kubernetes is noted in the [product's official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-kubernetes?view=iotedge-2020-11)

This example demonstrates how to expose an in-cluster [Kubernetes Service](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-compute-resources-container/) from an IoT Edge module.  It requires a Kubernetes cluster with Helm initialized and `kubectl` installed as noted in the prerequisites. You'll also be using VS Code with Azure IoT tools to work with the edge workload (deployment) manifest.

### Setup steps

1. As needed, follow the steps to [register an IoT Edge device](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/quickstart-linux#register-an-iot-edge-device). Take note of the device connection string.

1. [Set up VS Code and tools](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/iot-edge/tutorial-develop-for-linux#set-up-vs-code-and-tools), associate with IoT Hub from the previous step.

1. Follow steps, or a subset as needed, to install edge deployment into the cluster.

    > 
    > For simplicity, this tutorial doesn't specify a persistent store for `iotedged` during install. However, for any serious/PoC deployment, follow the best practice example shown in the [iotedged failure resilience tutorial](./ha.html).

    ```bash

    # Create K8s namespace
    kubectl create ns internal-service

    # Install IoT Edge CRD, if not already installed
    helm install --repo https://edgek8s.blob.core.windows.net/staging edge-crd edge-kubernetes-crd

    # Store the device connection string in a variable (enclose in single quotes)
    export connStr='replace-with-device-connection-string-from-step-1'


    # Install the edge workload into the cluster namespace
    helm install --repo https://edgek8s.blob.core.windows.net/staging internal-service-example edge-kubernetes \
      --namespace internal-service \
      --set "provisioning.deviceConnectionString=$connStr"

    ```

1. In the Visual Studio Code command palette (View menu -> Command Palette...), search for and select **Azure IoT Edge: New IoT Edge Solution**. Follow the prompts and use the following values to create your solution: 

   | Field | Value |
   | ----- | ----- |
   | Select folder | Choose the location on your development machine for VS Code to create the solution files. |
   | Provide a solution name | Enter a descriptive name for your solution or accept the default **EdgeSolution**. |
   | Select module template | Choose **Empty solution**. |

   You'll update **deployment.template.json** (see navigation pane on the left) to add a sample module that exposes an in-cluster endpoint as a Kubernetes Service.

1. Add a sample **aspnetapp** module under **edgeAgent's** **properties.desired** section as shown below. 

    >The **PortBindings** section of module's [createOptions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.34/#operation/ContainerCreate) is translated to a Kubernetes Service of type **ClusterIP** by default. This type of service is not accessible outside the cluster directly.
    >
    >You can change **HostPort** in the module's **createOptions** to configure the port exposed by the service.

1. Generate the workload deployment config by right-clicking the **deployment.template.json** in the left navigation pane and selecting **Generate IoT Edge Deployment Manifest**. This will generate the minified **deployment.amd64.json** under the **config** directory.

1. Update the configuration for the device by right-clicking **deployment.amd64.json** and selecting **Create Deployment for Single Device**. In the displayed list, choose the device created in step 1 to complete the operation.

1. In a few seconds, you'll see a new pods and services instantiated as defined in the deployment manifest. Check the Services in the namespace to confirm that there's an entry for **aspnetapp**.

    ```bash
    kubectl get services -n internal-service
    ```

### Cleanup

```bash

# Cleanup
helm del internal-service-example -n internal-service && \
kubectl delete ns internal-service

 ``` 
 ...will remove all the  Kubernetes resources deployed as part of the edge deployment in this example (IoT Edge CRD will not be deleted).
