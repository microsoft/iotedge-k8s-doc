# Helm chart install options

This section lists the `edgeAgent` and `iotedged` options can be set using command line or the Helm chart's [values.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/release/1.1-k8s-preview/kubernetes/charts/edge-kubernetes/values.yaml) file during installation.

Few examples in the [Tutorials](./examples.html) section demonstrate how to set the options from command line.
