> This preview integration of IoT Edge 1.x and Kubernetes will not be made generally available, and is no longer supported. The recommended way to run IoT Edge 1.x on Kubernetes is noted in the [product's official docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/iot-edge/how-to-install-iot-edge-kubernetes?view=iotedge-2020-11)

# Helm chart install options

This section lists the `edgeAgent` and `iotedged` options can be set using command line or the Helm chart's [values.yaml](https://github.com/Azure/iotedge/blob/release/1.1-k8s-preview/kubernetes/charts/edge-kubernetes/values.yaml) file during installation.

Few examples in the [Tutorials](./examples.html) section demonstrate how to set the options from command line.
